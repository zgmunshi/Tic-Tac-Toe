# Tic-Tac-Toe
This Git repository is dedicated to the development of a simple but fun Tic Tac Toe (Noughts and Crosses) game. Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game played on a 3x3 grid, where players take turns marking a cell with their symbol, aiming to get three in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
